The output of this pipeline at any tick is the probability that the person imagines each type of movement. Since the EEG patterns associated with these movements look different for any two people, several nodes (here: Common Spatial Patterns and Logistic Regression) must first adapt themselves based on some calibration data for the particular user. Moreover, it\u2019s not enough for the calibration data to be arbitrary EEG data, it must meet certain criteria (this same rule applies to pretty much any use of machine learning on EEG data). First, the node needs to obtain examples of EEG left-hand movement and right-hand movement, respectively. Also, a single trial per class of movement is not enough,  the node needs to see close to 20\u201350 repeats when using a full-sized EEG headset. Lastly, these trials must be in a randomized order, i.e., not simply a block of all-left trials followed by a block of all-right trials.

One way to do this is to include a special \u2018trigger channel\u2019 in the EEG, which takes on pre-defined signal levels that encode different classes (e.g. 0=left, 1=right). In that case, the pipeline assumes that the data packets emitted by the LSL Input node are not just one EEG stream, but also a second stream that has a list of marker strings along with their timestamps (markers), i.e., they are multi-stream packets and there are consequently two data streams flowing through the entire pipeline. The markers are then interpreted by the rest of the pipeline to indicate the points in time around which the EEG is of a particular class (in this pipeline, a marker with the string \u2018left\u2019 and time-stamp 17.5 would indicate that the EEG at 17.5 seconds into the recording is of class 0, and if the marker had been \u2018right\u2019 it would indicate class 1).\nOf course, the data could contain any amount of other random markers (e.g., \u2018recording-started\u2019, \u2018user-was-sneezing\u2019, \u2018enter-pressed\u2019), so how does the pipeline know what markers encode classes, and which classes they encode? This binding is established by the Assign Targets node. The settings are shown below. The syntax means that \u2018left\u2019 strings map to class 0, \u2018right\u2019 maps to class 1, and all other strings don\u2019t map to anything."),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"segmentation"},"Segmentation"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,(0,i.kt)("img",{alt:"Segmentation Node",src:a(44492).Z})),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The second question is, given that there\u2019s a marker at 17.5 seconds, how does the pipeline know where relative to that point in time we find the relevant pattern in the EEG that captures the imagined movement?

Extracting the right portion of the data is usually handled by the Segmentation node, which extracts segments of a certain length relative to each marker. The picture above shows the settings for this pipeline, which are interpreted as follows: extract a segment that starts at 0.5 seconds after each marker and ends at 3.5 seconds after that marker (i.e., the segment is 3 seconds long).
